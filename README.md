# TheMovieDb-List

Hi there!

Here are a few notes on this project for you guys at Edison.

While I tried my best to show the tools and libraries I like to use, this project wasn't really large enough for including things like dagger or a database.

Ideally there would also be a better method for switching between the list screen and details screen over starting a new activity However as far as i know there is no good library for it and it would have been too time consuming to write my own.

The app is structured to show an MVC style approach as I consider it to be the only valid “architecture”
